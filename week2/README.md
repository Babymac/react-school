### Counter!

In this weeks homework we would like you to use state a lot more to familiarize you with the concept further.  
In week2 you will find the folder named countdown with an empty js file and a css file with some classes.  
Try to create a counter that increases every second or by your own specifications by using state.  
If you need some assistance have a look in root/week2/examples.  
(optional) Try to reset the counter on the click of a button, or show us your own ways to manipulate this counter.
