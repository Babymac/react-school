## React Bootstrap
To make the coding part easier we have chosen to use React Bootstrap for CSS related coding.  
Since this course is not going to focus on any CSS we wont discuss this in the courses.  
If you still like to know more about it we suggest you have a look at the link bellow or check out the code base for this repo, for some examples of how to handle CSS in React.

## How to get started?!
You will find the lessons in the 'src' folder in the project.
You can also create your own folders to start up your homework in the same directory to make it easier to develop.
Name the folder 'homework' + number/name of the homework.

To start the project you can use the following commands.
* `npm run build` <- To build the project
* `npm start` <- Development mode
* `npm test` <- Runs tests
* `npm run eject` <- If you want to change the webpack/babel/lint etc.. settings run this, NOT REVERSIBLE!
