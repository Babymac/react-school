## How to get started?!
You will find the lessons in the 'src' folder in the project.
You can also create your own folders to start up your homework in the same directory to make it easier to develop.
Name the folder 'homework' + number/name of the homework.

To start the project you can use the following commands.
* `npm run build` <- To build the project
* `npm start` <- Development mode
* `npm test` <- Runs tests
* `npm run eject` <- If you want to change the webpack/babel/lint etc.. settings run this, NOT REVERSIBLE!
