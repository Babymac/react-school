## Homework

### Counter!

* In this weeks homework we would like you to use state a lot more to familiarise you with the concept further.
* In 3 you will find the folder named countdown with an empty javascript file and a css file with some classes.
* Try to create a counter that increases every second or by your own specifications by using state.
* If you need some assistance have a look in `root/3/examples`.
