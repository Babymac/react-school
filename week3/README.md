## Homework

### Your project

* This homework assignment will be the first real homework assignment, in the sense that you _have_ to do it :)
* You have two weeks to complete the homework.
* At next class (also in two weeks), you'll present what you've made to the rest of us.
* You can make whatever you want, but make sure that the following applies:
  * Abstract and compose components. Don't have one single "God" component that does everything, split it up. Make sure your components are at least three levels deep.
  * Use state so that your application _does something_. It shouldn't be only static, it should change based on user input or other events
  * Interact with a backend, using `fetch`. You can use a public API, [there's tonnes of them](https://github.com/toddmotto/public-apis).
  * Continue with app in `/app` or create a new app using [`create-react-app`](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) (which we used for the app in this project as well).
